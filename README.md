The editor for topcoder to automatically generate C/C++, Java, C# source code and test cases.
So can easily test the code with the examples given by topcoder.
Those code first comes from FileEdit, CodeProcessor and ExampleBuilder; if the author doesn't glad me to directly copy these code or have license problem, please let me known.


ExampleProcessor should have the setting page for
